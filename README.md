Agentic AI Certification Project
Ready Tensor Team — Final Submission
Author: Sai Spoorthy Eturu
This repository contains my complete submission for the Ready Tensor Agentic AI Certification Program.
The work is organised across three modules, each designed to demonstrate a different layer of building intelligent, reliable, and production-ready AI systems. Together, these modules cover retrieval-based intelligence, multi-agent coordination, and scalable deployment practices.
- Project Overview
This project consists of the following three modules:
1. Module 1 – RAG-Powered AI Application
This module focuses on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of answering user questions based on uploaded documents.
It includes document parsing, text chunking, embedding generation, vector-based retrieval, and grounded LLM responses with clear citations.
The goal is to minimise hallucination and ensure transparency in responses.
2. Module 2 – Multi-Agent System
Module 2 introduces an agent-based workflow designed to break down tasks and coordinate actions between specialised agents.
The system consists of four agents:
a. Planner
b. Retriever
c. Reader/Summarizer
d. Verifier
Each agent has a specific role, and together they form a structured pipeline that improves reasoning quality, interpretability, and task reliability.
3. Module 3 – Productionizing the Agentic System
This module focuses on turning the prototype into a deployable, maintainable, and scalable service.
It includes:
Docker containerisation
Suggested Kubernetes deployment structure
CI/CD workflow examples
Notes on monitoring, logging, and operational readiness
The goal is to transition from experimentation to a more robust production environment.
